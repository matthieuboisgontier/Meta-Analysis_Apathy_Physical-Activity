# Apathy and Physical Activity: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

## Rmd script
This repository contains an `Rmd` script "Apathy.Rmd" to conduct the meta-analysis examining the relationship between apathy and physical activity as well as subgroup meta-analyses and meta-regressions. 

## Data for analyses in Rmd
The data used in the Rmd script for the main meta-analysis based on on Pearson’s r are in "PA_Apathy_r.csv".
The data used for the secondary meta-analysis based on Spearman’s rho are in "PA_Apathy_rho.csv".
The data used for the p-curve analysis are in "Data for p-curve analysis.csv".

## R script
The exact-p calculation.R script was used to compute exact p-values when they were not reported in an article but sample size (n) and Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) were avaible. These p-values were then reported in Table 1 and used in the meta-analysis.
